# If a remote session of openocd is required and blocked by firewall rules, an 
# ssh tunnel can be set up. The port then appears as a local port:
#
# ssh -L 3333:localhost:3333 user@remoteHost
#
# Unless you have an ssh key set up, a password will be required.
#
# Then this command should return immediately. While running, port 3333 will redirect
# the activity to the remoteHost machine where openocd is set up to directly connect
# to the target machine.
